The dataset contains different types of data such as date, continuous and categorical.

### Project Objective

The purpose of this project was to practice skills in cleaning datasets and preparing data for analysis.

### Project Tasks

1. Bringing columns to a convenient format for further analysis.
2. Processing of parameters requiring additional cleaning and bringing to a common state
3. If necessary, create/delete parameters in the dataset

## STAGE 1: Data Understanding

We have 77 parameters, with no missing values.
We can divide them into subgroups:
- Basic information about the player
  ```
  'ID','Name','LongName','photoUrl','playerUrl','Nationality','Age','â†“OVA','POT','Club','Contract'
    
  'Positions','Height','Weight','Preferred Foot','BOV','Best Position','Joined','Loan Date End
